# Obesity Level Prediction with Random Forest 🥗🏋️‍♂️

## 📌 Project Overview
This project aims to estimate obesity levels based on individuals' eating habits and physical conditions. Using a **Random Forest Classifier**, the model classifies individuals into 7 different categories ranging from "Insufficient Weight" to "Obesity Type III".

## 🏆 Key Results
The model achieved a high accuracy rate on the test dataset.

- **Model:** Random Forest Classifier
- **Accuracy:** **95.51%** 🚀
- **Evaluation:** Confusion Matrix & Classification Report

## 📂 Dataset Features
The dataset includes data on eating habits and physical condition, with attributes such as:
- **FAVC:** Frequent consumption of high caloric food
- **FCVC:** Frequency of consumption of vegetables
- **NCP:** Number of main meals
- **CAEC:** Consumption of food between meals
- **CH2O:** Consumption of water daily
- **FAF:** Physical activity frequency
- **TUE:** Time using technology devices
- **Target Variable (NObeyesdad):** Obesity Level (7 Classes)

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas & NumPy** (Data Manipulation)
- **Scikit-learn** (Model Training & Evaluation)
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** (Data Visualization)

## 📊 Visualization
The project includes detailed visualizations such as:
- **Confusion Matrix Heatmap:** To visualize the performance of the model across different obesity classes.
- **Feature Importance:** To identify which factors (e.g., Weight, Gender) influence the prediction the most.
